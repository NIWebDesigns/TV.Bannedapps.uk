SKY making some changes, First he have done Premeir League and Main Event which we have managed to get back in 5 min, now he's hitting other channels too, Movies channels were gone down and we get them back again in 5 min. Keep me updated if any channel gone down, so i may try to fix it ASAP, no need to panic as we are not alone in it, every supplier facing same issues.
Thanks.
